## About

Welcome to my website! 

I'm Quan, a software engineer currently living in London. I am a a soon-to-be graduate of King's College London, and I will be working at The Trade Desk starting in September 2025. Professionally, my interests lie in backend development, scalable systems, and software infrastructure. This website will perhaps contain blog posts of my thoughts on various things, and a small portfolio of things that I've worked on at some point or another.

Currently I enjoy anime, video games, and just spending time with friends. However, I have previously dabbled in a few things such as speedrunning, speedcubing, table tennis and esports production.
