## About

Welcome to my website! 

I'm Quan, a software engineer currently living in London. I am a a soon-to-be graduate of King's College London, and I will be working at The Trade Desk starting September 2025. Professionally, my interests lie in backend development, scalable systems, and software infrastructure. This website will perhaps contain blog posts of my thoughts on various things, and a small portfolio of things that I've worked on at some point or another.

Currently I enjoy anime, video games, and just spending time with friends. However, I have previously dabbled in a few things such as speedrunning, speedcubing, table tennis and esports production.

## Career

  My first internship experience, I worked as a full-stack software engineer assisting in a project which handles the management of resources in operating rooms.

## Projects
+ **[SchemeVault](https://schemevault.willbl.dev/)**

  In collaboration with King's College, AWS, Wiltshire, and 5 other group members, I helped create a web application to index, sort, and query a database of support schemes that would benefit vulnerable families around the UK. It is currently being hosted as a trial service by the incredibly talented [Will BL](https://willbl.dev/). The application has a self-renewing database which discards stale data and scrapes for new data, the data science effort was lead by [Aman Bilkhoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman-bilkhoo-59b133299/), an incredible ML research engineer.

+ **[LoRA Poisoning of Diffusion Models](/dissertation.pdf)**

  Inspired by [Nightshade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13828), a novel poisoning attack targeted at image generation diffusion models, I decided to base my Bachelor's dissertation on developing a poisoning method targeted towards diffusion models using [Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685). Although not officially published, the results I found were promising! I was supervised by asssitant professor and machine-learning researcher [Atsushi Suzuki](https://ash-suzuki.github.io/).
