Credits
========

This is heavily based on [Eliza Weisman's][elizaweb] website, which I was made aware of by my friends [Yusuf][yusuf] and [Ptkyr][ptkyr]. Colour scheme is based on [Gogh's Base2Tone Drawbridge](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/). The font is [Fira Code][firacode] with italics pulled from [here][firacodeitalics].
